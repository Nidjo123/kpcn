# KPCN
PyTorch implementation of [Kernel prediction convolutional networks paper](http://drz.disneyresearch.com/~jnovak/publications/KPCN/) in form of Jupyter notebook.

The idea is to apply convolutional networks to denoise Monte Carlo renderings.

This was done as a part of my MSc term project at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER),
University of Zagreb, Croatia.
